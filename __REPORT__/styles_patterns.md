## Styles and Patterns

### SOA (Service-Oriented Architecture)

Design Pattern [style] in which separate components of an app are separated into standalone services that communicate by defined protocols (HTTPS). i.e., data sources communicate with only one service.
	
When to use: All elements within interface are implemented even when they are not needed (violating Interface Segregation Principle)
