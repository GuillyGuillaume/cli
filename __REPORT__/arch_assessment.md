## Archhitectural Assessment

### Principles:
- **Separation of concerns**: Each element is independent from each other.
    - Including various aspects of the system on a single representation will result in miscommunication between sections, and even leads to chaos in the model. 

    - In the npm cli model, in the library, it has different modules for different responsibilities. In total, it has 6 modules(auth, commands, exec, search, util and workspaces). 
    - Auth is mainly responsible for setting the credentials in npm to authenticate any npm repository.  
    - Commands are a set of npm actions. For example, npm access could set access levels on published packages. 
    - Exec module is used to run commands in the package. Json file, meaning they canâ€™t run scripts that are not in the local project dependencies. To run commands not in local dependencies, you have to install dependencies first. 
    - Search module is to search any packages in local project dependencies matching the keywords. To use this module, simply put npm search
    - Workspace means installed packages are being auto-symlinked as a single workspace. It refers to the nested packages in the package.json. You could initiate a new workspace using npm init. This is where you could execute your commands, search dependences and verify credentials.
    - The clear definition of responsibilities of modules allow the smooth data flow and prevent future chaos. 

- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each element is responsible to one and only one actor as is responsible for one simple task. This improves debuggability.



- **Open-closed principle**: The architecture scales seamlessly; can add functionality without modifying the code. E.g., npm usage is auto-generated for each new command (cli/scripts/config-doc-command.js).
