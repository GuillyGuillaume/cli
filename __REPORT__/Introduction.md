## Introduction

### Context

npm is a software registry for open source developers to share and borrow packages. npmâ€™s registry is a public collection of packages of open source software for front-end web apps, mobile apps, and many other JavaScript needs. npm is the command line client that allows developers to install and publish those packages.

### Background

npm was originally developed by Isaac Z. Schlueter. It was created in 2009 as an open source project to help JavaScript developers easily share packaged modules of code. npm has since been acquired and is under the management of Github, a Microsoft subsidiary.
