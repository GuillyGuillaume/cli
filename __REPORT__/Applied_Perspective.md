## Applied Perspective

### Performance and Scalability

Desired Quality 
The performance and scalability is the ability that a system has a required performance with prediction and will maintain the same performance when facing increased processing volumes.
In npm cli system, 
Applicability
We could have a performance and scalability perspective for any systems with complicated and high performance and want to do a significant expansion on the scalability.
Concerns
We are considering response time, throughput, scalability, predictability, hardware resource requirements, and peak load behavior 
Activities
In order to improve architecture, We will figure out the performance requirements, create and analyze the performance models, and probably have practical testing.
